# Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Coming soon! This advanced guide will cover:

1. **What is MoE?**
   - Sparse vs dense models
   - Expert networks
   - Router mechanisms
   - Top-K routing

2. **MoE Architecture**
   - Expert FFN layers
   - Gating network
   - Load balancing
   - Expert capacity

3. **Benefits of MoE**
   - More parameters without proportional compute
   - Better scaling efficiency
   - Performance comparisons with dense models

4. **Implementation**
   - Converting dense FFN to MoE
   - Efficient routing with MLX
   - Training considerations

5. **Experiments**
   - Dense vs MoE comparison
   - Scaling laws
   - Inference optimization

**Next**: After mastering dense transformers, we'll explore sparse MoE architectures.
