# Training Your LLM

Coming soon! This guide will cover:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loading and preprocessing text data
   - Creating training batches
   - Sequence padding and masking

2. **Training Loop**
   - Forward pass
   - Loss computation (cross-entropy)
   - Backward pass and gradients
   - Optimizer step (AdamW)

3. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Learning rate scheduling (warmup + decay)
   - Gradient accumulation
   - Gradient clipping
   - Mixed precision training with MLX

4. **Monitoring**
   - Training loss curves
   - Validation perplexity
   - Text generation samples
   - Checkpoint saving

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Learning rate
   - Batch size
   - Sequence length
   - Model architecture parameters

**Next**: After building the architecture, we'll implement the complete training pipeline.
